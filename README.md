# Privacy Friendly 2048

The Privacy Friendly 2048 app is an addictive puzzle game. The game is considered to be won if you reach the number 2048 by pushing the same numbers together. It belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps supported by the research group SECUSO.

This app is the optimal gadget to protect the user's privacy and at the same time playing 2048. The app can provide its full functionality without the need of any permission. Furthermore it does not use any tracking mechanisms or advertisement as other apps in the stores.

## Motivation

As many apps require a lot of the users informationâ€™s and also include advertisement, we design this privacy friendly alternative to provide only the functionalities without the needless inquerement of data. Supported by the SECUSO research group, the app optimized the user's privacy during the usage.

## Download and more Information

Further development requires Android Studio, we recommend to use at least version 3.1.1
For more information about the app and how it works, please take a look at the Wiki section.
